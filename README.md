_ripvcs (rv)_ is a command-line tool written in Go, providing an efficient alternative to [vcstool](https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool) for managing multiple repository workspaces.

Whether you are managing a few repositories or a complex workspace with numerous nested repositories, ripvcs (rv) offers the performance and efficiency you need to keep your workflow smooth and responsive.

## ðŸª„ Features

- **Enhanced Concurrency:** Utilizes Go routines to manage multiple tasks simultaneously,
  ensuring optimal performance and reducing wait times.
- **Recursive Import:** Supports recursive import functionality to automatically search for `.repos`
  files within directories to streamline the process of managed nested
  repositories dependencies.

## ðŸ§° Installation

### Using pre-built binaries

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/ErickKramer/ripvcs/releases) page.
2. Download latest binary
3. Make the binary executable
   ```console
   chmod +x rv
   ```
4. Move binary to a directory included in your `PATH`
   ```console
   mv rv ~/.local/bin/
   ```
5. Verify installation
   ```console
   rv help
   ```

## Build from source

1. Clone repository
   ```console
   git clone https://github.com/ErickKramer/ripvcs
   cd ripvcs
   ```
2. Build binary
   ```console
   go build -o rv main.go
   ```
3. Follow steps 3-5 from the "Using pre-built binaries" section.

## Usage

To check the available commands in _rv_ simply run `rv help`:

```console
rv help
